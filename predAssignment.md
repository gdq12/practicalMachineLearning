Background
==========

This project is based on data collected by activity trackers such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit. They inexpensively collect a large amount of data to quantify self-movement and find behavior patterns to improve health. This assignment is based on data from the [Human Activity Recognition (HAR) project](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har), which explores the development of context-aware systems with various purposes. This assignment particularly examines the data of weight lifting 6 participants with accelerometer sensors on their belts, forearms, arms, and dumbells. These participants were asked to perform barbell lifts in 5 different ways.

**The goal of this assigment** is to predict the manner in which the barbell lift was executed, which is identified by the outcome/dependent variable "classe", based on predictor/independent variables in the training set.

The **training data** for this assignment is to build machine learning (ML) algorithm and test: <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv>

The **test data** with which the ML algorithm will be applied to determine the excercise class of every observation: <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv>

The background information used to build the ML algortihm for this assignment is: Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H.
